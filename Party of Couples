You are given an integer array arr[] of size n, representing n number of people in a party, each person is denoted by an integer. Couples are represented by the same number ie: two people have the same integer value, it means they are a couple. Find out the only single person in the party of couples.

NOTE: It is guarantee that there exist only one single person in the party.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 5
arr = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
Output: 
3

Explaination: Only the number 3 is single.


Code SOlution - 

class Solution{
    static int findSingle(int n, int arr[]){
        // code here
        int Xor = 0;
        
        for(int i: arr)
            Xor ^= i;
            
        return Xor;
        
    }
}


Code Explanation - 

XOR operations - 

XOR truth table

0 0 = 0
0 1 = 1
1 0 = 1
1 1 = 0


XOR operations of a number with same number results in 0 and finally you get the single integer
